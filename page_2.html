			<h1>Balloon Festival</h1>
				<p>Here in New Mexico we have balloon festivals, an event where balloons are sent into the sky with all kinds of unique styles and colors. These events are complete with vendors, food, and other fun activities.
				When trying to capture some of the moments some I had to employ the use of these photography tips</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Pick the right time of day. When you are taking landscapes of the outdoors the sun is both your friend and enemy</li>
				<li>Placement of your subject. You can put it in the center, use the rule of thirds, or other methods, just make it interesting</li>
				</ul>
